Tidsmerke,"Abacus
Located in the central library, there will be an abacus for each activity (one for yoga, one for walking, one for ping pong etc.). Each abakus will have 16 columns (one column for each half hour from 09:00 till 17:00)
The beads on each column will represent how many people will be attending that particular activity at that particular 30 minute block.","Quick Game Table
A table with quick, lightweight games like Jenga or Uno that students can play during short study breaks.
Designed to encourage strangers or peers to interact for 3–5 minutes before returning to study.","Question of the Week
A big board with one open question (e.g., “What song helps you study?” or “Best hidden spot on campus?”). Students jot quick answers.","Collaborative wall painting / build project
A common project that students can participate on when they take a break. Collectively dependent on each others efforts, and possibly new friends if people place their break at the same time.","Study Lights
Red lights at study areas that turn green when it is time for a break. The idea is that it might be easier to focus if everyone collectively works, and enjoy social breaks as well. "
