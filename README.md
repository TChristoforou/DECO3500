## Problem Space
We are working with University Students at UQ
who are studying at the Central Library and
looking to engage in healthy social activities to
create opportunities to connect with other
students through an inventive exploration of
the possibilities of social and contextual
computing.

## Design Opportunity, Audience & Concepts 

__Design Opportunity:__
A key design opportunity lies in supporting university students who spend long hours studying in the library by giving them meaningful breaks. Instead of just passive rest, these breaks could include light physical activities, mindful recharge moments, or small social interactions that help students reset mentally and physically. Such interventions not only improve focus and well-being but also foster a stronger sense of belonging, which research shows is closely linked to academic success and student retention​

__Concept:__
Many university students spend long hours studying in the central library, often without taking meaningful breaks. Research highlights that students’ sense of belonging strongly influences their well-being, academic performance, and retention. However, prolonged study in isolation can reduce both focus and belonging. Designing interventions that encourage short, restorative breaks such as light movement or casual peer interactions can help students recharge while also fostering social connection. This balance not only supports mental health but also strengthens the sense of belonging that research shows is critical for positive student outcomes​

__Audience:__
University students who spend long
hours studying in the library.

## Previous attempts at UQ​

## Process

* decided on domain, did research on the topic, , did observations on the central library, based on the interesting research and observations we landed on a problem space, research on previus solution, created a presentation, created questions for interview, sent out form, based on everything we came up with some prototypes, set these prototypes in a form and sent out to students,

__Week 3:__  Domain & Initial Research
* Chose the domain: supporting the well-being of students.
* Conducted background research on student well-being, particularly at UQ.
* Began observations at the Central Library to understand student behaviors and needs.
* Noted potential opportunities for healthy social interactions within study environments.

__Week 4:__  Problem Space & Previous Solutions

* Refined the problem space: students spending long hours in the library with limited social interaction.

* Explored previous attempts at UQ to address this issue (e.g., social activities, support programs).

* Identified design opportunities around social and contextual computing to support well-being.

* Mapped out the target audience: university students at the central library.

__Week 5:__  Presentation & Interviews
* Created a presentation to articulate the problem, design opportunity, and initial findings
* Designed interview questions aimed at understanding students’ needs and experiences.
* Shared the interview plan with potential participants.

__Week 6:__  Surveys & Early Prototyping
* Sent out a form/survey to gather wider student input.
* Collected data from responses to complement interview insights.


__Week 7:__  Prototype 
* Based on observations, research, and student feedback, developed early prototypes of potential solutions.

* Created a prototype form that showcased the concepts for students to rate the prototypes
* Sent the prototypes to students for feedback.

__Week 8:__ 

Began reviewing responses to evaluate which ideas resonated most with the target audience.

Started refining design directions based on student feedback.
