# Ababreak

**Ababreak** is a hybrid physical–digital concept created for *DECO3500: Social and Mobile Computing* at The University of Queensland.  
It supports student well-being by encouraging meaningful social and mindful breaks within university library spaces.

---

## Project Overview

**Ababreak** combines an **interactive abacus installation** with a **digital prototype** to help students take short, restorative breaks during long study sessions.  
Each bead movement represents participation in a simple activity — like stretching, chatting, or practicing mindfulness — turning breaks into small, shared social moments.

The project aims to:
- Promote **mental wellness** and reduce study fatigue.
- Encourage **social connection** between students.
- Create a playful, low-effort way to join campus activities.

## Physical Prototype (Optional for Demo)

A tangible abacus installation representing real-world participation in Ababreak activities.  
Each row corresponds to a different activity type — for example:
- Stretch
- Chat
- Mindfulness

Students move one bead on the physical abacus whenever they participate in an activity.
