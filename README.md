## Problem Space
We are working with University Students at UQ
who are studying at the Central Library and
looking to engage in healthy social activities to
create opportunities to connect with other
students through an inventive exploration of
the possibilities of social and contextual
computing.

## Design Opportunity, Audience & Concepts 

__Design Opportunity:__
A key design opportunity lies in supporting university students who spend long hours studying in the library by giving them meaningful breaks. Instead of just passive rest, these breaks could include light physical activities, mindful recharge moments, or small social interactions that help students reset mentally and physically. Such interventions not only improve focus and well-being but also foster a stronger sense of belonging, which research shows is closely linked to academic success and student retention​

__Concept:__
Many university students spend long hours studying in the central library, often without taking meaningful breaks. Research highlights that students’ sense of belonging strongly influences their well-being, academic performance, and retention. However, prolonged study in isolation can reduce both focus and belonging. Designing interventions that encourage short, restorative breaks such as light movement or casual peer interactions can help students recharge while also fostering social connection. This balance not only supports mental health but also strengthens the sense of belonging that research shows is critical for positive student outcomes​
