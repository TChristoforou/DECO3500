# Ababreak

**Ababreak** is a hybrid physical–digital concept created for *DECO3500: Social and Mobile Computing* at The University of Queensland.  
It supports student well-being by encouraging meaningful social and mindful breaks within university library spaces.

## 🧩 Project Overview

**Ababreak** combines an **interactive abacus installation** with a **digital prototype** to help students take short, restorative breaks during long study sessions.  
Each bead movement represents participation in a simple activity — like stretching, chatting, or practicing mindfulness — turning breaks into small, shared social moments.

The project aims to:
- Promote **mental wellness** and reduce study fatigue.
- Encourage **social connection** between students.
- Create a playful, low-effort way to join campus activities.
